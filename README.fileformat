  Path: absolute path  (TODO: use os.path.expanduer)
   The path of the project work directory, if it's not the same as the log/todo file
  Abstract: true
   If set to anything, it means there is no work directory, so no attempt is
   made, for example, to interact with git. Useful for things like shopping
   lists
